## Installation

1. Open ULauncher and go to the settings (through the settings icon in the top right)
2. Go to Extensions and click `+ Add Extension`
3. Paste the link to this repository: https://github.com/JerryV22/Ulauncher-math-solver

## Note

For symbols without corresponding Unicode characters, the Unicode output may look weird.  
In those cases, it is recommended to use the LaTeX format.
